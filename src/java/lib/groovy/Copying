				Preamble

CHSM/Groovy is under a BSD-style license (given below).  All of CHSM, including
the run-time libraries, in particular the chsm.jar, is under the GNU General
Public License (GPL).  CHSM/Groovy uses the chsm.jar.

The authors of CHSM have relicensed the chsm.jar under a BSD-style license when
(and only when) used as part of the run-time for CHSM/Groovy.

Therefore you, as an end user, can use the chsm.jar (only when built from the
original, unmodified, CHSM source) under a BSD-style license when (and only
when) used as part of the run-time for CHSM/Groovy.

If you want to use a chsm.jar built from modified CHSM source, and those
modifications are not under the GPL, then you can no longer use a BSD-style
license and must instead revert to using the GPL.
